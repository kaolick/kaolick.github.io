# Privacy Policy – Scry 1

*Last updated: January 2026*

## 1. Responsible Party

The party responsible for data processing in connection with the app **Scry 1** is:

**kaolick**  
Contact: **kaolick@gmail.com**

---

## 2. General Principle

Your privacy is important to me.  
The app **Scry 1** is designed so that **no personal data is collected, stored, or processed**.

---

## 3. Data Collection in the App

The app:

- does not collect personal data  
- does not use tracking  
- does not use analytics tools  
- does not use crash or error reporting  
- does not include a login system  
- does not store user data on servers  

The app does not permanently store any personal data on its own servers.

---

## 4. External Data Requests

The app loads content from an external service:

**Scryfall API (api.scryfall.com)**

When retrieving this data, a technical connection to Scryfall’s servers is established. In doing so, the device’s IP address may be transmitted to Scryfall.

I do not collect, store, or process any personal data myself in this process.  
Scryfall’s own privacy policy applies to their data handling:
